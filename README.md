# Customer-Personality-Analysis
Many brands and stores have their loyalty programs, and the sales assistants will ask for your personal information to get you involve in the programs with your first purchase. After that, the brands can track your shopping behaviors through both your browsing history and purchase record both instore and online. They also can email you the newest campaigns with good offers. This project is standing at the side of the seller to mimic the analysis before marketing. Summarizing the customer segments with different income and background and analyzing the shopping habits of each segment to increase the selling.
